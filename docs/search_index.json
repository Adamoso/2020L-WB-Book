["index.html", "ML Case Studies Preface Technical Setup", " ML Case Studies 2020-04-13 Preface This book is the result of a student projects for Case Studies course at the Warsaw University of Technology. Each team prepared an article on one of the topics selected from reproducibility, imputation, and interpretability. This project is inspired by a book Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich XAI Stories. Case studies for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence done at the Warsaw University of Technology and at the University of Warsaw. We used the LIML project as the cornerstone for this repository.

Technical Setup The book chapters are written in the Markdown language. The simulations, data examples and visualizations were created with R (R Core Team 2018) and Python. The book was compiled with the bookdown package. We collaborated using git and github. For details, head over to the book’s repository. "],
